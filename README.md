Just after finishing my masters, I moved to Tokyo to work as Web developer for Rakuten. After living there for 3 years, I moved to Germany.I have a long experience of working with ruby on Rails.
I like to traveling, listening to the music, learning about finance and stock market. In my studies, I consider securing a place in India's best engineering college is an achievement for me.\
I have long experience of working with Ruby on Rails.

I started my career with an established huge company Rakuten in Tokyo. After working there for 3 years I decided to move to Germany.
Since then I have worked in different companies and sectors. 
Currently, I am working at YogaEasyGmbH in Hamburg. I have mostly the back-end experience with little bit of front-end technologies with Angular.
With Rails, I have experience of creating APIs, integrating payment systems, search engines like Solr.
